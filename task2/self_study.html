1- display ({inline, inline-block, flex}):
	the display property as its name says is specifying how the element will appear to the user.	
	.inline: will make the element diplay as an inline element meaning it will not go to a new line and will appear next to the other elements. meaning it will be horizontally instead of vertically.
	.inline-block: it will display as inline to the viewer but you can use inside of it other elements as if it is a block element.
	.flex: it is a way to design and sort the elements by making a box that will sort the elements inside of it in the way you want. 

2- ID selector:
	.it is a unique id for elements. 
	. no more than one element should have and id.
	. to use it as a selector we gave the id to an element then call it with '#' in the css code.
